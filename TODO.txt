Keep track of:
- gm channel msgs on role events
- Every message needs a reply
- send messages to roles telling them itâ€™s their time to act
- add all commands to known_commands
- add new roles to role_switch_dict
- write role instructions to topics


Soon:


At some point:

- dead people gc
- on_member_update() to keep track of nickname changes; space in nickname should be prevented, unique nicknames should be required
- on_user_update() to keep track of username changes
- GM can't use $join; maybe add debug mode where this isn't the case?


Possibilities:

- Have mutilation mute a player in voice (and text?)
  - on status update check if they unmuted themselves, then remute them
- Custom death texts for each role
  - picky werewolf:
    "In his death throes they begin to change. His limbs lengthen, his fingers become wicked claws, and his eyes become starry, far seeing and endless. In an instant it is over, and all that hangs before you is a dead wolf. But it is clear to all that the {} is no more.. "

- mute players during night
- Automatic checks on whether all roles have performed their actions for a certain gs?
- timer on voting


Questions:
- does the elder protect against mutilation by the wolves
