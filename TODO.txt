Keep track of:
- use display_name instead of nickname
- gm channel msgs on role events
- Every message needs a reply
- send messages to roles telling them it’s their time to act
- add all commands to known_commands
- add new roles to role_switch_dict


Soon:

Lynching
- print statement and channel message in $lynch to make clear
  how many players have voted

- Win condition function; called on every death

- check duplicate names in $join
- check duplicate roles in $gamestart except for werewolf and civ

- write role instructions to topics


At some point:

- dead people gc
- on_member_update() to keep track of nickname changes; space in nickname should be prevented, unique nicknames should be required
- on_user_update() to keep track of username changes
- if player is mutilated, on status update check if they unmuted themselves, then remute them
- in $leave : if in the middle of a game: “are you sure? This will kill you. If so, use $quit”
- $remove to remove a player by the gm; same effect as $quit
- GM can't use $join
- Custom death texts for each role

Questions:
- does the kidnapper kidnap just the target or everyone at the house (slut)

 
Edgecases:

- Witch cannot heal a mutilation

TOCHECK
- GM end night before any ww votes
- Pick after the vote is decided
  - the picked tries to vote then? 


Possibilities:
- mute players during night
- Automatic checks on whether all roles have performed their actions for a certain gs?
- timer on voting
