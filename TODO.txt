Keep track of:
- use display_name instead of nickname
- gm channel msgs on role events
- Every message needs a reply
- send messages to roles telling them it’s their time to act
- add all commands to known_commands
- add new roles to role_switch_dict
- write role instructions to topics


Soon:

- Seer
  - Check that seer can't target themselves


At some point:

- dead people gc
- on_member_update() to keep track of nickname changes; space in nickname should be prevented, unique nicknames should be required
- on_user_update() to keep track of username changes
- in $leave : if in the middle of a game: “are you sure? This will kill you. If so, use $quit”
- $remove to remove a player by the gm; same effect as $quit
- GM can't use $join; maybe add debug mode where this isn't the case?

Possibilities:
- Have mutilation mute a player in voice (and text?)
  - on status update check if they unmuted themselves, then remute them
- Custom death texts for each role
- mute players during night
- Automatic checks on whether all roles have performed their actions for a certain gs?
- timer on voting


Questions:
- does the elder protect against mutilation by the wolves
